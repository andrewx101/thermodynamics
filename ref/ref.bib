Only relative, not absolute, velocities can be physically detected. Absolute accelerations cannot be detected by purely kinematrical means, but they have a dynamical effect, namely inertia. It is to account for inertia that Newtonian and Eulerian mechanics employ absolute space. It was clearly recognized only recently that this is the only role that absolute space may play, and that the effect of the dependence of space on the frame of reference in all considerations unrelated to inertia must be taken into account by means of principles of frame-indifference.},

This progress is achieved by accounting for two features of macromolecules that the original approach ignores: the effects of chain connectivity in the case of dilute solutions, and the ability of polymer coils to change their spatial extension in response to alterations in their molecular environment. In the general case, this approach leads to composition-dependent interaction parameters, which can for most binary systems be described by means of two physically meaningful parameters; systems involving strongly interacting components, for instance via hydrogen bonds, may require up to four parameters. The general applicability of these equations is illustrated in a comprehensive section dedicated to the modeling of experimental findings. This part encompasses all types of phase equilibria, deals with binary systems (polymer solutions and polymer blends), and includes ternary mixtures; it covers linear and branched homopolymers as well as random and block copolymers. Particular emphasis is placed on the modeling of hitherto incomprehensible experimental observations reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Since the early ages any progress in thermodynamics, in fact its birth itself, results from the observation of phenomena combining heat and mechanical effects. This is also true in chemical thermodynamics. In addition, in particular in solution thermodynamics, chemical effects must be taken into account. From this point of view, solution thermodynamics is a science of observation developed from judicially conceived experimental measurements that characterize and quantify the contributions of the chemical species involved. Using the formal rather simple scheme of basic relations built from equally simple thermodynamic principles, the thermodynamic behavior resulting from the chemical interactions of an investigated chemical system can be related to the chemical potentials of the system’s components. Experimental thermodynamics is a science by itself. In this context, calorimetric techniques play a major role in providing essential data used to build theoretical models capable of being used further in chemical engineering applications. Heats of mixing, heats of interaction, and heats of dilution constitute the primary data to be measured. After a short review of the thermodynamic formalism and basic relations, the state of the art in solution calorimetry to determine the above heats is described. For an in-depth study of molecular interactions, the pressure as well as the temperature dependence of these thermodynamic properties must be documented. The thermophysical properties that are the second derivatives of the Gibbs energy with respect to temperature and pressure are of paramount importance since they can be related directly to the molecular level, opening windows to molecular thermodynamics. Scanning transitiometry, which can provide experimentally all the thermophysical properties, is described in detail. I give from my personal march in the field a view of the most recent developments in experimental techniques including their extensions to operate over extended temperature and pressure ranges. Selected striking results in pure liquids and mixtures, and in polymer systems, serve to illustrate the role of well-designed experimental techniques in providing exclusive data of the best quality. The aim was indeed to stress also the pivotal role and impetus of Robert H. Wood in modern chemical thermodynamics.},

The interpretation of the osmotic second virial coefficient depends on the solution theory. On the macroscopic level an expansion of the osmotic pressure is employed. A common statistical interpretation of the osmotic second virial coefficient of the expansion employs the McMillan–Mayer framework and the potential of mean force to characterise the solute–solute interaction. Supplementary to the statistical interpretation, it may be advantageous to develop the McMillan–Mayer framework in a classical thermodynamic context for which we develop the relationship between the state function of the McMillan–Mayer framework and the Helmholtz state function. A Taylor expansion method can be applied to the osmotic pressure of a solution which is dilute with respect to at least one solute component. This offers the possibility for an interpretation and correlation of the osmotic second virial coefficient utilising a McMillan–Mayer state function derived from a Helmholtz state function.},

  abstract = {On long time scales, the random Brownian motion of particles diffusing in a liquid is well described by theories developed by Einstein and others, but the instantaneous or short time scale behavior has been much harder to observe or analyze. Kheifets et al. (p. 1493) combined ultrasensitive position detection with sufficient data collection to probe the Brownian motion of microbeads in fluids on time scales that are shorter than the characteristic bead-fluid interaction time. The motions of Brownian particles are tracked and evaluated on short time scales where solvent effects play a role. Measurement of the instantaneous velocity of Brownian motion of suspended particles in liquid probes the microscopic foundations of statistical mechanics in soft condensed matter. However, instantaneous velocity has eluded experimental observation for more than a century since Einstein?s prediction of the small length and time scales involved. We report shot-noise?limited, high-bandwidth measurements of Brownian motion of micrometer-sized beads suspended in water and acetone by an optical tweezer. We observe the hydrodynamic instantaneous velocity of Brownian motion in a liquid, which follows a modified energy equipartition theorem that accounts for the kinetic energy of the fluid displaced by the moving bead. We also observe an anticorrelated thermal force, which is conventionally assumed to be uncorrelated.},

In a recent note I showed that Langmuir's adsorption isothermwhere θ is the fraction of the surface covered by adsorbed gas, p the gas pressure in equilibrium with it, and A (T) a specified function of the temperature, can be derived as a theorem in statistical mechanics without any appeal to the mechanism of deposition and re-evaporation. Necessary and sufficient assumptions for the truth of (1) are that the atoms (or molecules) of the gas are adsorbed as wholes on to definite points of attachment on the surface of the adsorber, that each point of attachment can accommodate one and only one adsorbed atom, and that the energies of the states of any adsorbed atom are independent of the presence or absence of other adsorbed atoms on neighbouring points of attachment. Under these assumptions the explicit form of (1) iswhere m is the mass of the adsorbed atom or molecule, bg(T) the partition function for its internal states in the gas phase, and vs(T) the partition function for its set of adsorbed states. These sets of states are to be so specified that the energy zero is assigned tot the lowest state of each set in constructing bg(T) and vs(T), and then X is the energy required to transfer a molecule from the lowest adsorbed state tot the lowest gas state. Quite another adsorption isotherm was shown to hold when adsorption of a molecule takes place as atoms and requires two or more points of attachment.},

  abstract = {The possibility, pointed out in a previous paper, of superlattice formation in an adsorbed layer when the adsorbed atoms tend to repulse each other is developed in detail. Both Bragg and Williams's approximation and Bethe's approximation are used, but restricted to superlattices of the type AB. In a range of θ, the fraction of surface covered, a superlattice is found to be possible. Bragg and Williams's approximation shows further that the state with the lowest free energy is the one with a superlattice when the latter is possible. Rough kinetic expressions are also given. The equations derived from the principle necessary to preserve equilibrium are found to reduce to those of detailed balancing, and they also agree with the formula obtained statistically. As expected, all the corresponding results obtained from the two methods become the same when the number of nearest neighbours of a site approaches infinity, provided that the product of this number and the interaction potential of two adsorbed atoms occupying two neighbouring sites remains finite.The only significant result is the large value of the slope of isotherms (the rate of change of the pressure with respect to the fraction of adsorption) when there is a nearly complete superlattice.},

When we use the first expression to construct the configurational partition functions of certain physical assemblies and expand them in powers of 1/kT, they are found to agree with the corresponding rigorous expressions as far as (1/kT)3, which is the highest power which we can find rigorously at present. With the help of the first expression, formal equations for superlattice formation in an alloy with the composition 1: 1 and equations for the separation into phases of regular liquids are given. Lastly we show that atoms and molecules in a regular liquid may dissociate or recombine suddenly accompanied by a latent heat. This is a new cooperative phenomenon, which may bear some resemblance to the melting process between the solid and liquid states.},

Bethe's method is used to determine the equilibrium conditions of the corresponding order-disorder problem, and the number of configurations is determined from these equilibrium conditions. For the case in which the molecules occupy two closest neighbour sites on the surface the determination of the number of configurations from geometrical considerations is discussed.It is found that for molecules which occupy two closest neighbour sites the number of configurations of particles for a square lattice, a simple cubic lattice and a body-centred cubic lattice respectively are and For molecules which occupy three sites on the lattice the corresponding results are and when the molecules are perfectly flexible and and when the molecules are completely inflexible, Ns being the total number of sites in the lattice.The author wishes to thank Dr J. K. Roberts for suggesting this work; the geometrical treatment given in § 3 was developed from manuscript notes prepared by him.

The vapour-pressure equations are compared with those which have already been obtained by Fowler and Guggenheim for the case in which each solute molecule contains two submolecules in order to determine the effect on the form of the vapour-pressure equations of the number of submolecules in each solute molecule. This enables the determination of the vapour-pressure equations when each solute molecule contains n submolecules and occupies n lattice sites in such a way that successive submolecules occupy closest neighbour sites on the lattice. In this latter case the vapour-pressure equations areThese equations are used to determine the osmotic pressure of solutions of long-chain polymers, and it is found that in the region of osmotic interest, the osmotic pressure is given by an equation of the formwhere c g. of solute per 100 c.c. of solution is the concentration. It is shown that this equation can be written approximatelywhich is the quadratic relation which has usually been fitted to osmotic measurements. To this approximation π/c plotted as a function of c gives a straight line of which the intercept on the π/c axis determines the molecular weight of the polymer molecule and the gradient determines the number of submolecules in each polymer molecule.},

  abstract = {IN 19201 I directed attention to the fact that the solubility of solids, plotted as a logarithm of mole fraction against reciprocal temperature, gives a family of curves in the case of solutions “where no molecular changes are involved”. In 19272 I designated such solutions as ‘regular’ and in 19293 I discussed the thermodynamic significance of this regularity, stating, in part: “From our picture of a regular solution as one in which orienting and chemical effects are absent, and in which the distribution and orientations are random, just as in an ideal solution, we may conclude that the probability of X2 [species 2] is the same in the two solutions [ideal and actual] and, therefore, that the difference in entropy is zero. We cannot expect this conclusion to hold unless the random distribution of molecules persists. We may expect further that a small correction should be applied to take care of the change in entropy accompanying changes in volume, given by (∂S/∂V)T = (∂P/∂T)V; or we may state our principle in the following form. A regular solution is one involving no entropy change when a small amount of one of its components is transferred to it from an ideal solution of the same composition, the total volume remaining unchanged.”},

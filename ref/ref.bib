This view evolved gradually over the past eight years. A first version was given in a series of lectures I delivered at the Summer Session in Bressanone, Italy, in 1965 (reference [1]). The material was reworked several times for an introductory graduate course repeatedly given at Carnegie-Mellon University and for lecture series given at the University of Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1968 and in Jablonna, Poland, in 1970. This paper is the latest version, and it renders reference [1] obsolete.},

Even the natural philosophers of of the Renaissance realized, however, that space has physical relevance only with respect to a frame of reference. Only relative, not absolute, velocities can be physically detected. Absolute accelerations cannot be detected by purely kinematrical means, but they have a dynamical effect, namely inertia. It is to account for inertia that Newtonian and Eulerian mechanics employ absolute space. It was clearly recognized only recently that this is the only role that absolute space may play, and that the effect of the dependence of space on the frame of reference in all considerations unrelated to inertia must be taken into account by means of principles of frame-indifference.},
